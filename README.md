# hyg-usb_linux

hyg-usb is a small temperature and relative humidity sensor YOU CAN HACK. It is based on a PIC 16F1455
and a Si7021 sensor and comes with a preinstalled firmware ( see http://www.macareux-labs.com for details )

This command line tool will allow you to read its data and control the three leds interactively under Linux.

## Installation

### Dependencies

	apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev

iconv and bzip2 should already be installed on most systems.

### Getting the sources

The sources are available on github: https://github.com/macareux-labs/hyg-usb_linux
You can retrieve them as a zip file with your favorite web browser or,better, just use git :

	git clone https://github.com/macareux-labs/hyg-usb_linux.git

### Compiling and installing

## Synopsis

       hyg-usb [-h] [-v] [-T] [-H] [-R] [-Y] [-G]
               [-r led_mode] [-y led_mode] [-g led_mode]

Each led can be in three modes : ON, OFF and AUTO.
When set to AUTO, a given LED will blink each time a new measurement is made by the sensor.


## Options

       -h     display a short help text and exit

       -v     dispay version number and exit

       -T     display current temperature in Celcius

       -H     display current relative humidity in %

       -R     display current mode for red led

       -G     display current mode for green led

       -Y     display current mode for yellow led

       -r led_mode
              set mode for red led ( can be ON,OFF or AUTO )

       -g led_mode
              set mode for green led ( can be ON,OFF or AUTO )

       -y led_mode
              set mode for yellow led ( can be ON,OFF or AUTO )

       -s bus:device
              select device(s) based on bus number and/or device number
              (0 mean any).

when used without any option, hyg-usb will display temperature and relative humidity.
